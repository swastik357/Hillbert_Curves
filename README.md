Hilbert Curve space filling of 2-D plane enables locating "nearest points to source point" which is used in applications like "nearest restaurants to a house" .

eg. If house is at point 5 in Hilbert space filling curve of 2-D plane, we can choose restaurants within distance 2 to it (points 3,4,6,7) on the Hilbert space 
filling curve of 2-D plane.

If distance between points on Hilbert space filling curve of 2-D plane is less => Points are "Euclidean close". 

But converse is not true. That is "Euclidean close" points can be far away on Hilbert space filling curve of 2-D plane.
